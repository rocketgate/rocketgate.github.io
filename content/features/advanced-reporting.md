# Advanced Reporting

RocketGate's advanced reporting system, “Mission Control” gives you the information necessary to make well-informed business decisions. Real-time reports are available online so you can view data anytime, anywhere. Mission Control allows you to view reports in a variety of formats such as HTML, CSV, PDF and XML. Merchants wishing to integrate data into in-house reporting applications can utilize an API to retrieve any of the reports programmatically.

## Mission Control answers key business questions like:
* How many members do I have and what is my recurring success rate?
* Which of my merchant accounts performs the best?  
* Do I have a bad affiliate?
* What is my pricing “sweet spot”?
* What are the best days of the week for sales & marketing initiatives?
* How can I configure my load balancing to take advantage of the bank with the best authorization rates?

<br />

## Features:
* Detailed dashboards, reports and graphs
* Printer-friendly PDF and graphical views of data
* Export to CSV/Excel
