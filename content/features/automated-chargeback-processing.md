# Automated Chargeback Processing

Protect your business with RocketGate’s automated chargeback processing service. When a chargeback, retrieval or reversal is received (via a daily digital feed),RocketGate will automatically mark the transaction as a chargeback, cancel a subscription (if applicable), block the customer from making future purchases, add the credit card number to a negative database and then send the data to the merchant via postback.

The tool suite also includes a Chargeback Queue tool that lists retrieval and chargeback data for review with built-in workflow management. In addition, RocketGate’s sophisticated reporting helps to identify fraudulent activity from affiliates, consumers and issuing banks **before** chargebacks occur. This proactive approach improves your bottom line. Retrieval requests and chargebacks can be responded to efficiently and easily in order to get reversals as quickly as possible.
