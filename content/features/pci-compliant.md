# PCI Compliant

RocketGate is a Tier 1 certified Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliant service provider.

<a href="https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/" target="_blank"><img alt="" style="float: right;" src="/images/pci-badge.png"></a>

The **P**ayment **C**ard **I**ndustry **D**ata **S**ecurity **S**tandard (PCI DSS) is a set of requirements designed to ensure that **all** companies that **process**, **store** or **transmit** credit card information maintain a secure environment. The PCI DSS is administered and managed by the [PCI SSC](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/), an independent body that was created by the major payment card brands (Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover and JCB.).  It is important to note, the payment brands and acquirers are responsible for enforcing compliance, not the PCI Security Standards Council.

## PCI Solutions for RocketGate merchants:
**1. [Hosted Page](/payment-processing-services/hosted-page)**

RocketGate collects the credit card information on your behalf so you can reduce the scope of your PCI compliance efforts because you are not storing or transmitting sensitive data.

[See the lifecycle of a Hosted Page Transaction](/images/files/hosted-page.png)

**2. [Hosted Form](/payment-processing-services/hosted-form)**

Credit card data is entered by the customer and then is transmitted directly to RocketGate. You are no longer required to be PCI compliant because you are not processing or transmitting sensitive data.

**3. Tokenized Payment Processing**

RocketGate returns a unique token after the initial transaction that allows you to process subsequent transactions without storing credit card data.

You are no longer required to be PCI compliant because you are not processing, storing or transmitting sensitive data.
