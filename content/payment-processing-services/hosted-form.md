# Hosted Form
Hosted Form is engineered for those who want maximum branding control and flexibility.  In the Hosted Form solution, you host the purchase page and include an iFrame from RocketGate where the credit card data is entered by the customer and then is transmitted directly to RocketGate.  This gives customers a seamless purchase experience from beginning to end.

## Tokenized Payment Processing
This can be used whether you are connected to RocketGate via Gateway or Hosted Page or Hosted Form methods. RocketGate returns a unique token after the initial transaction that allows you to process subsequent transactions, such as recurring billing, without storing credit card data. This feature is supported by both our Gateway and Hosted Page solutions. See the lifecycle of a [Gateway Tokenized Transaction](/images/files/gateway-token.png) and the lifecycle of a [Hosted Page Tokenized Transaction](/images/files/hosted-page-token.png).
