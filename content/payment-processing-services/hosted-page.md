# Hosted Page
Engineered for merchants who want the easiest integration or who do not want to host an SSL (secure sockets layer) site. In the Hosted Page solution, you link to a purchase page (hosted by RocketGate) where RocketGate securely collects credit card data on your behalf so you don’t have to store, transmit or process the credit card data. You control the look and feel of this page via the use of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets).

## Tokenized Payment Processing
This can be used whether you are connected to RocketGate via Gateway or Hosted Page or Hosted Form methods. RocketGate returns a unique token after the initial transaction that allows you to process subsequent transactions, such as recurring billing, without storing credit card data. This feature is supported by both our Gateway and Hosted Page solutions. See the lifecycle of a [Gateway Tokenized Transaction](/images/files/gateway-token.png) and the lifecycle of a [Hosted Page Tokenized Transaction](/images/files/hosted-page-token.png).
